# LSD Similarity and Correlation

This repository will investigate Semantic Similarities and Correlations of Linked Statistical Datasets (LSD). By testing different datasets and sections, the ongoing hypothesis will be to see whether the strength of the correlations between the datasets have anything to do with the degree of their semantic similarity.


## Documentation
Coming soon to a theatre near you.


## Workflow

1. Get metadata of datasets.
2. Get each dataset's observations.
3. Create correlations and other analysis for each dataset pair combination.
4. Create dataset metadata subset for semantic similarity.
5. Create semantic similarity for each dataset pair combination.
6. Create correlation and other analysis for worldbank.similarity-correlation.R.
7. Sip coffee and see if the plot makes any sense.


## Requirements

* Bash
* R (ggplot2)
* SPARQL Endpoint (to pull data from)
* [SemanticCorrelation](https://github.com/albertmeronyo/SemanticCorrelation) (to create a similarity matrix)
